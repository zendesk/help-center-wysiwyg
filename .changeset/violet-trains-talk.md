Update `MentionsDataProcessor` to store the `data-user-name` attribute value from the <span> element in a constant variable (userName) before resetting the elementâ€™s classes and attributes. This ensures we retain the original value, which could otherwise be lost when clearing the attribute map. We then set the `data-user-name` attribute on the new <x-zendesk-user> tag using this variable. This change prevents a bug where the attribute value could become undefined if accessed after resetting the attributes.
